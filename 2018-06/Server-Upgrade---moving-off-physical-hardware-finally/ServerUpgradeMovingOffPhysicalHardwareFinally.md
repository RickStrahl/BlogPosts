# Server Upgrade - moving off physical hardware finally

If you visit this blog regularly you probably know that I've been running for a long, long time on physical hardware. I've had a co-located Windows box at my local ISP here in Hood River for over 20 years now and it's been a good ride. It's been a good deal along with great performance even out here in the boonies.

The server I've been running is going on 10 years old and while there haven't been any problems I've been getting nervous in the last couple of years worrying about hardware failures.

### Moving off Physical Hardware
I've been really slow moving off my physical hardware so I'm late to the cloud party. It's not for the lack of wanting to move to cloud servers (or SaaS for that matter), but this server being that 20+ year old legacy that it is, has a bunch of stuff on it that literally requires me to run a dedicated Windows instance or VM.

The other reason I've been reluctant even to move to a Virtual Machine setup for my Windows instance is that frankly VM price/performance has been a really fucked up situation. A few years ago I installed VMs on various cloud providers and using hardware that on paper looked similar to the hardware I was running was nearly twice as expensive and provided half the performance of the 10 year old server. Not much of a motivator that scenario.

And so... I waited. Tried again a couple of years later - Azure, AWS, Google hosting and it all sucked unless you spend a few hundred dollars a month **just to match the performance of the old hardware** which seems ridiculous.
