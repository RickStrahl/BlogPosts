# Use Visual Studio Code with Web Connection

Visual Studio Code is a relatively new general purpose editor from Microsoft. This editor has nothing to do with the full version of Visual Studio other than the unfortunate name association - it's a cross platform editor that is very fast and very easy to use. You can use it on Windows, Mac and Linux.

It feels very smooth and the minimal UI is very clean and  the core editor itself - even though it's built in JavaScript - is blazing fast. There's an easy, JavaScript based extension model that has spawned a huge number of high quality addins in a very short time. If you're developing in a particular framework there's likely to be an extension available for it.

And yes - there's even a minimal [FoxPro syntax highlighting module](https://github.com/mattslay/Visual-FoxPro-language-template-for-Visual-Studio-Code) available - courtesy of Matt Slay. It's not in the extension library, so you have to grab it from Github and manually move the files.

There's a nice Folder browser built in that can serve as a 'Project' view for files, especially in Web applications and this is what I'll look at in this post for using VS Code in combination with West Wind Web Connection.

In the post I've been - and still am - very big on using 
[West Wind Web Connection](https://west-wind.com/webconnection) in the full version of Visual Studio, which by comparison to Code is a behemoth.
