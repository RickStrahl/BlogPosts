# What can I Get Away With?

Sigh. I'm having one of those moments where I need to vent a bit. It's been a rough busy, rough week of dealing with various institutions and also with a number of people individually.

More and more it feels to me like the fabric of society is just falling apart. Even well intentioned people these days seem to have lost context with what is considered 'acceptable behavior' anymore.

Let me vent by elaborating.

### What can I get with... for Free?
To an extent this is something that most of us are probably guilty off. Today our society is built around a lot of bait and switch schemes that are set up based on the promise of getting something for nothing, only to have that paradigm switched on you at some point in the future once you're hooked and don't have an easy way to get off.

This can be software or services etc. On the one hand there are many thing that are awesome that are available for free. I can think of a bunch of things:

* DropBox 
* Evernote
* Github

### Reverse that on me
