# The new Pain: Same as the old Pain - HTML

> For all the talk of how awesome HTML(5) is why are we STILL spending hours on each project hunting for a bloody date picker, auto-complete, multi-pick control that'll work w/ framework du jour? 20+ years in & nothing has changed. No standard component model, no UI standardization


> Today it seems all focus is on JavaScript frameworks. But JS is not even close to the biggest pain point of modern Web development - it's the limitations and quirks HTML that are the biggest time sink in just about any project I've worked on.

> People need to start voicing these concern and not clamour for the constant change of superficial features du jour.

> It seems with HTML the 'perfect platform' is always 2 years away and then... well we know how that ends. 2 more years... but then it'll be all that.
