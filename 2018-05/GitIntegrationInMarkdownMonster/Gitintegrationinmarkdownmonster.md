# Git Integration in MarkdownMonster
Git source control is becoming ubiquitous for just about any **developer** and **documentation** related scenario. Locking away stable versions and being able to roll back to them is vitally important as a backup mechanism and if you are working with multiple people on a project, Git's distributed nature makes it relatively easy to share your work, and most importantly allows you to work together and share your changes in a unified way.

Markdown Monster is an editor and as such used extensively for writing developer related documents or just general documentation and Git and source control play a big role in most of those workflows.

### Git Improvements in Markdown Monster 1.10.16 and later
Starting with version 1.10.16 Markdown Monster gains a bunch of new Git integration features, which makes it much easier to perform common Git tasks directly from within Markdown Monster.

Here are a few things you can now do from within MM:

* See Git Status in the Folder Browser
* Commit and push the active document 
* Select and commit & push any pending file
* Undo pending changes
* Ignore files
* Use your preferred Diff tool to compare files
* Open your preferred Git Client
* Clone a repository

These are some of the most common tasks that you see in common Git clients and now they are also directly integrated into Markdown Monster.

### Why integrate? There's already tooling available
