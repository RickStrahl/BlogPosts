### Optional Dependencies

- [csearch](https://github.com/google/codesearch)

    To search gists on your local machine.
    If not available, fallbacks to `grep`.
If you've edited your gists at `gist.github.com` or local machine, without pull/push changesets, you can sync all your gists via `gister sync`.

If you've deleted your gists at `gist.github.com`, after `gister sync`, the directories of deleted gists at your local machine will be marked with a prefix `_`.

Markdown
As I went through this, I updated the text and eventually ended up with a mini-blog like entry. The thought process is there as well as the solution. Because it's Markdown I can now also pick up the Markdown - as is - and stick it into my Markdown editor for a future blog post which saves some additional time.

#### Gist as Mini Blogs
Because Gists support Markdown that is turned into HTML, you can use it to create one off HTML pages that you can easily share. If you don't have a blog and you want to write up something you found during development this is a great way to put out something public. Even if you have a blog you might have content that's too small or not a good fit for a blog and you can write it as a Gist instead. Sort of a blog away from your blog :smile:
I also use Gists for storing non-sensitive configuration settings. Machine configuration scripts short registry scripts, I have them shuttled away as private gists that I reuse when paving a machine.

### CSV gists from R objects

In my work I spend a lot of time sharing data with others and I've often been
frustrated when I had to download a data export from an anlytics machine R job
only to upload it to a GitHub gist for sharing. I used the Vim gist plugin for

Store your bootstrap configuration in github gists, compose into recipes.
Boostrapping recipes change from time to time. Gists are nice because they're
one-off, low-maintenance, hosted, and can easily change over time.

Scrape finds interesting data in text files using keyword searches and regular expressions. Scrape pulls text files from Pastebin and Github Gists. In addition, Scrape can parse text files in a local directory. The search terms are user configurable and are stored in the config.json file. Scrape can run in the background as a service or it can run on demand.
To use scrape with Github Gists, you will need to create a read-only Github API key. Scrape gets the 100 most recent gists using the API endpoint described at: https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/#list-all-public-gists. At this time, no attempt is made to download truncated files or truncated content.
