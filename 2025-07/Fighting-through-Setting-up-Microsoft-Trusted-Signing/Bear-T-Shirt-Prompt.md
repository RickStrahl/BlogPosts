### Main T-Shirt Design

T-Shirt Design Concept: “Gale Force Grizzly”

Visual Elements:
Centerpiece Graphic:
A muscular, soaked and wet grizzly bear is gripping a vintage-style windsurfing rig, captured mid-air as it launches off the crest of a massive, frothy wave. The bear’s fur is matted with spray, its expression fierce, with water droplets flying off its face and claws. The bear should look aggressive but not 
menacing. Make sure the sail is not rendered too tiny in proportion to the bear.

Waves:
Stylized like 1980s surf posters, the wave has curling, exaggerated lines with goldenrod with white highlights line art for highlights and texture. The motion lines mimic wind gusts, giving a wild, dynamic feel.

Bear Fur Texture:
Done in scratchy halftone-style crosshatching, suggesting vintage screenprint texture.

Board & Sail:
A multi-paneled sail with with a stylized Goya Windsurfing logo in the top panel. Make sure the boom is a single piece and the bears hands are on the right side of the boom holding on.

Typography:
Top Arc (over image):
“GET OFF” – Bold, distressed slab-serif with slight warp to follow the arc.
Color: Slightly faded muted yellow-gold, giving that sun-aged look.

Bottom Arc (under image):
“MY WAVE” – Same type as above but slighly smaller, matching the retro-surf aesthetic (think early Quiksilver or Santa Cruz skate).


Color Palette:
All design elements are in faded goldenrod, with bone-white highlights, and warm gray linework and fills.

Don't show the T-Shirt - just the print art that goes on a black or transparent background for a T-Shirt print.


### Try to fix the Aggro Bear image into a Badge Image

![Windsurf Bear Original](../../../Art/Bear%20Art%20-%20Amazon/T-Shirts/WindsurfBearOriginal.png)

Can you create a badge image from this image with the words Get Off  (top) My Wave (bottom) around the image. The image should be similar to the image provided with a bit more contrast using the same goldenrod plus some white highlights. 

The badge text should be bone-white, and use a very bold sans serif text of 80's style surf posters. The entire image should have a distressed look like an old t-shirt. 

This will be a print used for printing on a black t-shirt
