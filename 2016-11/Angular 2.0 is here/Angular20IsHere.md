# Angular 2.0 is here

About a month ago Angular 2.0 finally shipped are long delays and a tumultuous period of betas and RCs. After spending quite a bit of time with the final release and now 2.2 I can honestly - all the pain prior to release aside - that Angular 2.0 was worth the wait. It's a solid framework that is - after an initial bout of adjustment if you're coming from Angular 1.x - is much more logical, easier to work with, and requires significantly less code than Angular 1.0 did. And while there is a somewhat opaque build process involved in debugging and building Angular 2.0 applications, the good news is that this process has been automated via either Angular-Cli or the Angular-Seed project to allow you to just *get on with it*. 

To wit of the level of change - I'm writing a post about a general feeling of Angular 2 and already we are on Angular 2.1 a mere month after release.

### The long Road to Release
It seems these days the reality is that major frameworks take a long time to get out the door and ready for the masses and the path of getting to that final release is riddled with rabbit holes and dead ends along the way. As was my experience with ASP.NET Core which was plagued by major changes up until the final RC was released, Angular 2.0 also went down a number of paths that eventually ended up getting reversed out and backtracked. But, also like ASP.NET Core, I think the end result can't be faulted for that. I think it's important to remember if you want to be an early adopter - or pre-release adopter - you have to be ready for that early adopter pain that comes with it. But sometimes that's hard to bear when you see something that has a label of **Relase Candidate** on it. Angular 2.0 landed a new router, switch over to a WebPack based build system, a new application module manager all in the last couple of RCs all of which brought major breaking changes to anybody who had build code previously.

But again it's important to understand that all's fair in pre-release cycles when it comes to breaking changes - even if those of use who jumped in early had to pay the price. In the end the last minute changes were among the best choices (IMHO) made by the Angular team that resulted in big improvements to the usability and feature set of Angular.

### Comparing to Angular 1.0
I've been doing development with Angular 1.0 for close to 5 years and I really liked Angular from the get-go. Maybe because it was the first big JavaScript framework I used, and the fact that it brought the much needed structure to break out code into modules, but either way Angular 1.0 brought me a huge jump in productivity when it came to building front end applications. Prior to Angular I had build a pseudo abstraction framework that provided some level abstraction to break out code in to modules, but it was very basic and verbose. Angular 1.0 tied all of that together by its module loading features. Of course Angular 1.0 also introduced.

Angular 2.0 continues a lot of the same concepts, but makes much of the repetive code less obtuse. And - there's a lot less of the cermonial code. THere still
