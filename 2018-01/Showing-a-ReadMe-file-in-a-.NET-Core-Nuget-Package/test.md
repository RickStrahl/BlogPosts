<p>CODE Framework does its best to apply smart default settings to services (both server-side and client-side) for the typical type of application build with CODE Framework (business applications). Nevertheless, it is often desirable and necessary to change
 settings for services. This topic provides an overview of settings applicable to services.</p>
<p>Note that nearly all service settings (which are applied through the standard <a href="http://codeframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=CODE%20Framework%20Configuration%20System">
CODE Framework Configuration System</a>) can be made globally for all services, or individual on a per-service basis. For instance, it is possible to set the allowable message size for all services through the ServiceMessageSize setting, and it is possible
 to apply that setting for a single service (example: ICustomerService) by adding a ServiceMessageSize:ICustomerService setting.</p>
<p>It is also possible to add settings programmatically in various ways. The most common approach is to use static events fired by the ServiceGarden (server-side) and ServiceClient (client-side) classes. These events grant access to all the low level WCF objects,
 so any conceivable WCF setting or manipulation can be made. A very common use of this feature is to arbitrarily change the URL a service is hosted at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Server-Side Settings</h3>
<p>These settings can be applied in server-side projects (these settings are used by the ServiceGarden class, which in turn is used by all CODE Framework WCF hosting environments):</p>
