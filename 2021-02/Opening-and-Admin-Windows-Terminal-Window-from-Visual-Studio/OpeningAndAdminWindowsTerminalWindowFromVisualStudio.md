title: Opening an Admin Windows Terminal from Visual Studio
abstract: Opening Windows Terminal from another application is a bit of a pain. In particular I wanted to open Windows Terminal as an External Tool from Visual Studio and found it wasn't as easy as referencing the `wt.exe` executable. Opening as an Administrator adds additional complexity. In this post I'll talk about the use case of an External Tools and the settings to launch both a regular and admin Windows Terminal instance from External Tools.

# Opening an Admin Windows Terminal Window from Visual Studio

![](WindowsTerminalAdmin_Banner.png)

This isn't the first time I've talked about this, and probably won't be the last, but for my work in Visual Studio I often need an Admin Windows terminal window. I need it for a couple of build tasks - Chocolatey installs of an admin install and for a funky certificate that doesn't want to work from the User certificate store. Long story short for one of my builds - Markdown Monster in particular - I need to run the terminal as an admin.

I use a bunch of External Commands in Visual Studio (and also in Rider and WebStorm) to execute external tasks and tie them to menu hotkeys (ie. Alt-T-A, Alt-T-W, Alt-T-G etc.):

### Launching Windows Terminal From Visual Studio External Tools
Windows Terminal is a tricky tool to launch on External Tools, because the main executable `wt.exe` is an alias that launches the real binary. I can find the binary here:

But if I try to launch that in Visual Studio I get:

Not really sure what the problem is, but it has something to do how Visual Studio launches executables. You can't just use the global `wt.exe` without a path (as you can with say `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe`, so I have to provide the full path. But even the full path fails when the command is actually run. Hrmph! ðŸ˜¢


#### Windows Terminal Non-Admin
The workaround for this is to use **indirect invocation** by using Powershell or Cmd to launch it in which case the alias works and the path is no longer required.

Here's what this looks like:

![](WindowsTerminalExternalTool.png)

**Title**
`&Windows Terminal`

**Command**  
`cmd.exe`

**Arguments**  
`/c wt.exe -d "$(ItemDir)"`


And this works.

#### Windows Terminal Admin
To open an Admin Windows Terminal is more complicated. The same approach can be used but it's also necessary to elevate. I was thinking that PowerShell and `Execute-Process` with `-verb RunAs` would work, but I was unable to make that work. 

In the end the only way I could get this to work was by using a third part elevator tool. I used [GSudo from Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gsudo) and here's what that looks like:

![](WindowsTerminalAdminExternalTool.png)

**Title**  
&Admin Windows Terminal

**Command**
`C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\gsudo\bin\sudo.exe`

**Arguments**
`cmd.exe /c wt.exe -d "$(ItemDir)"`

This works but it does pop up an extra Command Window for the elevation box first. When the final instance of Windows Terminal loads that window then goes away. 

### Summary
Launching Windows Terminal from other applications is more hassle than it should be. This is due in part to the fact that Windows Terminal is actually a Window Store app and `wt.exe` is not a proper launch EXE but merely a small alias launcher. I've also had problems with this in [Markdown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com) trying to launch a shell from there. In MM too, I ended up using a command shell to launch `wt.exe` and that works, but this is ugly as heck. However it works and gets the job done.

It would be really nice if Windows Terminal could include a way to internally launch as Admin via a `-RunAs` or `-Verb RunAs` switch to provide an elevated launcher, but currently that's not possible as far as I know.

In the meantime the intermediate launching with cmd seems to work, although the for elevation and intermediary tool like GSudo is required.

Hope somebody finds this useful. I'm sure I will next time I need to set up a new machine :smile:...
