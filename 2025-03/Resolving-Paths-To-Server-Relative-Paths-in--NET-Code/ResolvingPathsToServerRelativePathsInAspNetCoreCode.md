abstract: ASP.NET Core has support for resolving Urls in Controllers and Razor Pages via embedded `~/` links in Views and via `Url.Content()`. But, these features are tied to Controllers or Razor Pages - what if you need to resolve Urls elsewhere, in middleware or even inside of business logic? In this post I describe how you can build a couple of helpers that are more flexible and also provide some additional functionality of resolving site root and relative paths to full site root paths.

# Resolving Paths To Server Relative Paths in .NET Core Code

![Path Resolution Banner](PathResolutionBanner.jpg)

ASP.NET Core automatically resolves 'virtual' paths in Razor pages or views to a site relative path. So if you have something like:

```html
<script src="~/lib/scripts/helpers.js" />
```

It will resolve to the appropriate root Url of the site. In most cases that will be a root path:

```
/lib/scripts/helpers
```

But if you're running the Web site out of a virtual folder you may have a folder like `/docs/` as the root for the site in which case the above resolves to:

```
/docs/lib/scripts/helpers
```

In other words, `~/` resolves the path to the site root.

You can also use `Url.Content()` in Razor Pages and Views and in Controller code to do the same conversion in your controller/Razor Page code.

The problem with both of these solutions is that they are tied to an `ActionContext` so you need a Controller or Razor Page Context to use it. If you are in those environments - great, that works just fine. But if you need to access this functionality in Middleware, an API or elsewhere deeper in the request pipeline or even in your business or custom rendering layer, there's no direct support for this functionality.

The automatic and `Url.Content()` conversions are also limited to resolving the `~/`  expression. I personally also prefer to resolve any root and relative Urls to their site relative Urls which is not supported by the `Content()` method.

> **Related:**  This post discusses resolving site relative paths that resolve to the `/` or `/docs/` style root path of an application. If you're looking for **physical path resolution** that maps a site's virtual or relative path to a physical path on disk there's a separate post that discusses `MapPath()` functionality:

##AD## 

## Why even resolve Urls?
Url resolution is not something you need to do often. Mainly because the vast majority of sites run on the root folder (`/`). If you know that's **always** the case you can skip the whole `~/` bit and just use `/` instead.

```html
<script src="/lib/scripts/helpers.js" />
```

But that can get you in trouble if for some reason in the future the site no longer runs on root, but moves to a sub folder like `/docs/`. Now all those `/` links point to the wrong site, the root site rather than the docs site resulting in broken links.

It's also an issue if you need to resolve parts dynamically as part of some business logic that perhaps needs to dynamically create links in documents. For example, I'm running into this with fixing up documentation links to other topics and ensuring those links are referenced properly regardless of root path because the resulting documentation can be published anywhere - including in site sub folders. In order for the site to work during the editing cycle and the deployed cycle, there needs to be a way to resolve the Urls correctly between the two modes (... sites essentially) which may or may not have the same root path.

Long story short, there are situations where `IUrlHelper` doesn't work or could use some additional functionality.

## Custom Url Resolution
It's not as easy to do Url resolution in ASP.NET Core as it was in ASP.NET but luckily all the pieces that you need are available for us to build our own Url resolution that can run independently of ASP.NET features or at least without a controller context.

### Getting the Path Base
The first and probably most important bit is the requirement to figure out the running Web site's base path: As long as you're inside of a running `HttpContext` and `HttpRequest` you can easily retrieve the site base path based on the current request with:  

```cs
string siteBasePath = HttpContext.Request.PathBase.Value;
```

This gives you either `""`  for the root or `"docs"` a `/docs/` folder or `"docs/class-reference"` for `/docs/class-reference/` in host scenarios.

For simple scenarios you can replace a path like `~/somepage`, by replacing `~/` with `$"{siteBasePath}/"` for example. 

### Creating a ResolveUrl() Helper that uses an active HttpRequest
To make this a bit more generic and to also add additional  functionality to also allow fixing up site root paths (ie. `/`) and relative paths, I've created helper method that resolves Urls more generically. 

There are two versions:

* **An extension Method for HttpContext**  
This version can take advantage of the available request information to retrieve the current URL, the Host and the PathBase without explicitly specifying anything.

* **A Core String Based Helper Method**  
This version does the same thing as the extension method but has no ASP.NET dependency. But it requires that some of the path components are passed in since they can't otherwise be automatically determined.  This allows usage from anywhere assuming you have access to the host Path and Host information (perhaps from separate configuration) in some form. This is useful if you do custom templating (which happens to be one of my use cases) or if you need to resolve paths from an API or from within business logic where you don't have access to the ASP.NET request intrinsics.

### An HttpContext.ResolveUrl() Extension Method
Let's start with the Context version which likely is the more common use case.

This code requires **an active HttpContext and HttpRequest** but it has no dependency on an `ActionContext` so it's more widely usable than `Url.Content()` plus it provides some of the previously discussed additional resolve features.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Resolves of a virtual Url to a fully qualified Url.
///
/// * ~/ ~ as base path
/// * / as base path
/// * https:// http:// return as is
/// * Any relative path: resolved based on current Request path
///   In this scenario ./ or ../ are left as is but prefixed by Request path.
/// * Empty or null: returned as is
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>Requires that you have access to an active Request</remarks>
/// <param name="context">The HttpContext to work with (extension property)</param>
/// <param name="url">Url to resolve</param>
/// <param name="basepath">
/// Optionally provide the base path to normalize for.
/// Format: `/` or `/docs/`
/// </param>    
/// <param name="returnAbsoluteUrl">If true returns an absolute Url( ie. `http://` or `https://`)</param>
/// <param name="ignoreRelativePaths">
/// If true doesn't resolve any relative paths by not prepending the base path.
/// If false are returned as is.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ignoreRootPaths">
/// If true doesn't resolve any root (ie. `/` based paths) by not prepending the base path.
/// If false are returned as is
/// </param>
/// <returns>Updated path</returns>
public static string ResolveUrl(this HttpContext context,
                                string url,
                                string basepath = null,
                                bool returnAbsoluteUrl = false,
                                bool ignoreRelativePaths = false,
                                bool ignoreRootPaths = false)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(url) ||
        url.StartsWith("http://", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
        url.StartsWith("https://", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        return url;

    // final base path format will be: / or /docs/
    if (basepath == null)
        basepath = context.Request.PathBase.Value ?? string.Empty;

    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(basepath) || basepath == "/")
        basepath = "/";
    else
        basepath = "/" + basepath.Trim('/') + "/"; // normalize

    if (returnAbsoluteUrl)
    {
        basepath = $"{context.Request.Scheme}://{context.Request.Host}/{basepath.TrimStart('/')}";
    }

    if (url.StartsWith("~/"))
        url = basepath + url.Substring(2);
    else if (url.StartsWith("~"))
        url = basepath + url.Substring(1);
    // translate root paths
    else if (url.StartsWith("/"))
   {
        if(!ignoreRootPaths && !url.StartsWith(basepath, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        {
            url = basepath + url.Substring(1);
        }
        // else pass through as is
    }
    // translate relative paths
    else if (!ignoreRelativePaths)
    {
        url = basepath + context.Request.Path.Value?.Trim('/') + "/" + url.TrimStart('/');
    }

    // any relative Urls we can't do anything with
    // so return them as is and hope for the best

    return url;
}
```


Here are a few examples using this version of `ResolveUrl()`

```cs
// based on a root path of /docs/

string path = Context.ResolveUrl("~/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png");
//  /docs/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png

path = Context.ResolveUrl("/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png");
//  /docs/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png

path = Context.ResolveUrl("../fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png");
//  /docs/fundraisers/../fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png 

path = Context.ResolveUrl("fundraiser/23123", basepath: "/docs2/")
// /docs2/fundraisers/fundraiser/23123
```

This code will translate:

* Urls that start with ~/ and ~  

* Urls that start with `/` and that don't already have the root base path      
<small>*(this may cause an occasional mismatch if you really mean to reference something in a parent site. You can disable this behavior optionally)*</small>

* Relative Urls  - based on current path
<small>*(relative Urls are prefixed with base path and current path. In some cases those paths will include `../` or `./` but those will be prefixed by the solved current path. Can be disabled optionally.)*</small>

Fully qualified Http Urls are passed through as is. There are options to not process relative and site rooted Urls, which unlike `Url.Content()` are fixed up in the routine by default.
e `Url.Content()` does.

You can also return an absolute `https://` or `http://` Url, which is useful in some scenarios especially for external linking. 

### A non-ASP.NET based ResolveUrl() helper
I also created another helper that doesn't have any dependencies on `HttpContext` or `HttpRequest` or anything in ASP.NET for that matter. This requires that you provide some of the parameters explicitly, so this is not quite as convenient as the `HttpContext` extension method. 

Here's that version:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Resolves of a virtual Url to a fully qualified Url. This version
/// requires that you provide a basePath, and if returning an absolute
/// Url a host name.
///
/// * ~/ ~ as base path
/// * / as base path
/// * https:// http:// return as is
/// * Any relative path: returned as is
/// * Empty or null: returned as is
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>Requires that you have access to an active Request</remarks>
/// <param name="context">The HttpContext to work with (extension property)</param>
/// <param name="url">Url to resolve</param>
/// <param name="basepath">
/// Optionally provide the base path to normalize for.
/// Format: `/` or `/docs/`
/// </param>
/// <params name="currentpath">
/// If you want to resolve relative paths you need to provide
/// the current request path (should be a path not a page!)
/// </params>
/// <param name="returnAbsoluteUrl">If true returns an absolute Url( ie. `http://` or `https://`)</param>
/// <param name="ignoreRelativePaths">
/// If true doesn't resolve any relative paths by not prepending the base path.
/// If false are returned as is.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ignoreRootPaths">
/// If true doesn't resolve any root (ie. `/` based paths) by not prepending the base path.
/// If false are returned as is
/// </param>
/// <returns>Updated path</returns>
public static string ResolveUrl(
    string url,
    string basepath = "/",
    string currentPathForRelativeLinks = null,
    bool returnAbsoluteUrl = false,           
    bool ignoreRootPaths = false,
    string absoluteHostName = null,
    string absoluteScheme = "https://")
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(url) ||
        url.StartsWith("http://", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
        url.StartsWith("https://", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        return url;

    // final base path format will be: / or /docs/
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(basepath))
        basepath = "/";


    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(basepath) || basepath == "/")
        basepath = "/";
    else
        basepath = "/" + basepath.Trim('/') + "/"; // normalize

    if (returnAbsoluteUrl)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(absoluteHostName))
            throw new ArgumentException("Host name is required if you return absolute Urls");

        basepath = $"{absoluteScheme}://{absoluteHostName}/{basepath.TrimStart('/')}";
    }

    if (url.StartsWith("~/"))
        url = basepath + url.Substring(2);
    else if (url.StartsWith("~"))
        url = basepath + url.Substring(1);
    // translate root paths
    else if (url.StartsWith("/"))
    {
        if (!ignoreRootPaths && !url.StartsWith(basepath, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        {
            url = basepath + url.Substring(1);
        }
        // else pass through as is
    }
    else if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(currentPathForRelativeLinks))
    {
        url = basepath + currentPathForRelativeLinks.Trim('/') + "/" + url.TrimStart('/');
    }

    // any relative Urls we can't do anything with
    // so return them as is and hope for the best

    return url;
}
```

This works in a similar fashion to HttpContext examples, but depending on what you want to support you you may need to pass in more information about the host and current request:

```cs
// based on a root path of /docs/

string path = WebUtils.ResolveUrl("~/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png", "/docs/");
//  /docs/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png

path = Context.ResolveUrl("/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png", "/docs/");
//  /docs/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png

path = Context.ResolveUrl("../fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png","/docs/"
                          currentPathForRelativeLinks: "fundraisers/");
//  /docs/fundraisers/../fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png 

path = Context.ResolveUrl("fundraiser/23123", basepath: "/docs2/",
                          currentPathForRelativeLinks: "fundraisers/");
// /docs2/fundraisers/fundraiser/23123

path = Context.ResolveUrl("/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png", "/docs/", 
                          absoluteHostName: "localhost:5200");
//  https://localhost:5200/docs/fundraiser/s4dd2t2a43/images/images-1.png
```

Note that more than likely you'd want to pass in all the parameters for base path, current page and host information, if you're processing the Url generically. This information could come from configuration or some other mechanism if you're outside of the ASP.NET context.

##AD##

I use a slight variation of this function in my own template engine. In one application that creates Html output from templates it's used to create and fix up links to other topics in this documentation system. Since this code is generated rather than served at runtime, there's no HttpContext or Request so this string based approach is used to resolve Urls correctly for the site that the app is eventually published to.

## Summary
Url resolution is something I seem to have reinvented a million times for various different frameworks, going all the way back to my old FoxPro WebFramework nearly 30 years ago. It's a good thing to have at hand, even though it's not something that you need commonly. Since most Web frameworks have some version of Url resolution built in, often they are very closely tied to that framework - if you need to use url resolution outside of that scope you need to do the resolution yourself.

In this post I've described a couple of helpers that do exactly that and even if you don't use these as is, they should give you the basis for resolving Urls in any Web scenario...
