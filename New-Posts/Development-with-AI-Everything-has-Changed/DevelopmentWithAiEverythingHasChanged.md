# Development with AI:  Everything has Changed

AI has transformed the way I work and from what I can gleam from what people post online, the same is true for most developers. How much AI is used and how varies widely, which is not surprising given the versatility of what AI knowledge and generation can provide.

While some people are slapping together entire apps with Vibe Coding, others use AI as a help engine to identify and fix problems.  Others use it as a co-developer for doing things like code reviews, throw-shit-at-wall-experimenting, architecture discussions and so on. Others use it for lighter code generation, figuring out algorithms and components... there are a million ways that AI can help with software development.

In my own work, AI has made me immensely more productive utilizing a combination of many of the things above. I'd have to say my biggest biggest gain comes from the ability to ask random questions that normally would go into a search engine and getting a highly focused answer back quickly. I've also had a lot of success with code generation for very focused problems - generating small algorithmic code, or components and the like. Some of the stuff that I've been able to generate would have taken me forever to figure out and code so again, so much so that I might not have attempted it in the first place. 

For me personally I've tried my hand at Vibe coding full apps or even smaller applets, but that didn't go well for me, resulting in code that either wouldn't run or was a pile of horrible spaghetti code that was completely unmaintainable. 
  
### Not all Roses and sunshine
But it's not all roses and sunshine. 

There are lots of AI failures that I've run into especially when you get into the edges of development. In those cases I've run into AI Hallucinations where the AI just makes up random shit that is completely off the rails and incorrect. I've also had other solutions created that confidently proclaimed to be a solution, only to find that when I actually tried to run it that it fantastically failed to do what it was supposed to. But often even these false attempts can lead to solutions that I could adjust and work with.



Some premises to discuss:

## Working with AI

### Good

* Development Help
    * Resolve Issues
    * Create small support functionality
    * 
* Troublehooting
    * A vast knowledge base at your finger tips
    * 
    * 
### Bad

* Inaccurate Results
    * Results are often not reliable
    * AI Hallucination
    * 

## Developer Related Activities

* How it has affected blogging
    * Drastically reduced audience
    * Reduced interaction

* Blogging
    * Less relevant
    * Users no longer search for finding answers
    * Short attention span

* Social Media
    * Developer discussions have all but disappeared
    * Related: Split platforms have splintered the market
    * Limited reach
    * Limited interest
