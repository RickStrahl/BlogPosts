# Development with AI: Everything Has Changed

## I. Introduction

1. Opening anecdote / personal snapshot of “AI in my workflow”
2. Thesis: how AI has fundamentally reshaped developer life

## II. The New AI-Powered Development Landscape

1. From search engines to “Vibe coding”
2. AI as co-developer: code reviews, architecture chats, experimentation
3. Spectrum of AI usage—from lightweight helpers to end-to-end app generators

## III. Productivity Boosts & “Good” AI Experiences

1. Instant, context-aware Q\&A (versus traditional web search)
2. Focused code generation

   * Algorithms & small components
   * Support utilities & boilerplate
3. Troubleshooting super-powers

   * Debug tips
   * Vast knowledge base at your fingertips
4. Examples of wins & “aha” moments

## IV. Pitfalls & “Bad” AI Experiences

1. Inaccurate results and hallucinations
2. Unrunnable or unmaintainable “spaghetti” code
3. Over-confidence of AI suggestions
4. Turning failures into learning opportunities
