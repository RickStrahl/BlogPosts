# Visual Studio Multi-Edit Keys

Visual Studio has an enormous set of keyboard shortcuts, many of which are not directly accessible in any other way than these keyboard shortcuts.

Some of those that are extremely useful but hard to remember are the multi-edit keys.

## Multi-Edit keys


### Multiple Cursors

* `Ctrl-Alt-Click` **Select Multiple Cursors**

* `Alt-Shift-.` **Select Next identifier for Multi-Cursor**   
This one basically takes the identifier highlight under the cursor and selects the next one and adds it to the multi-cursor group. Keep clicking to add additional identifiers. 

* `Alt-Select` **Vertical Multicursor selection**



### 

* `Ctrl-K-S` **Surround With**
* `Ctrl-K-D` **Format Block**
