# Cry for the AI
AI is the hot topic du jour and the hype and hyperbole surrounding it is off the charts.

If you're in software development you've likely heard and more than likely played around with the various AI implementations like ChatGPT, the various Bing APIs, Google Bard and so on. You may have even used some of the developer specific AIs like GitHub CoPilot.



## Not all Sunshine and Rainbows!
For all the accolades and "AI will solve all the world's problems" there are also equally many calls for doom and gloom. There's the over the top shit that AI will take over and kill us all - well Ok, maybe, but you know it's much more likely the madmen in charge of our governments today are going to do that than any AI.

But there are many more subtle issues that are being discussed that have to do with side effects that AI usage has. 

For example, check out this statistic that has Stack Overflow drastically dropping in usage:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This makes me sad:<a href="https://t.co/j7W5RiBYkA">https://t.co/j7W5RiBYkA</a> <a href="https://t.co/kBRkasnz8n">pic.twitter.com/kBRkasnz8n</a></p>&mdash; Mahesh Sathiamoorthy (attending ICML) (@madiator) <a href="https://twitter.com/madiator/status/1683735923387936768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now it's not clear that this precipitous drop off is all due to AI usage in tech queries as the fall starts before AI tools became widely available last year, but it certainly accellerated some since then.

This brings up questions:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Given that most of this traffic decline is the result of ChatGPT, trained on SO&#39;s content, what&#39;s going to happen to LLMs if they slash-and-burn farm the user-generated content + platforms they depend on to stay current and relevant? <a href="https://t.co/HFWDpjAzOq">https://t.co/HFWDpjAzOq</a></p>&mdash; Aaron Stannard (@Aaronontheweb) <a href="https://twitter.com/Aaronontheweb/status/1683907715116957699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

My response to this is that what's really freaky is if you read the comments how many people shit on StackOverflow not understanding that relationship between the AI content and where it comes from and what happens once the source dries up.

There are a number of disruptive aspects to AI, but the one that concerns me the most is that it will end up eliminating many original sources or force those source to go behind non-open pay or log in walls to keep out the AIs, and replace the organic content with generated or moderated crap, or 'sanctioned' content instead of organic information. Informatiion that then fits narratives that can be controlled by those owning the AI machinery meaning  big corporations and eventually government that are the only ones that can afford to run the AI technology.

If you run that thought process to its conclusion that's a scary fucking picture where you end up in an information desert where all information looks like those bot farm sites that have generic content that provide seemingly relevant content on the surface with the actual meat missing just below.
