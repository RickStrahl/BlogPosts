# An AI for an Eye


## AI is wonderful

## Wrong Think
AI can produce results that are close but not quite correct, resulting in lots of extra work

## Bias
AI Bias can result in output that leans in a specific direction and favors one side over another. 

## AI Guardrails
AI Guardrails can often put limits on what you can do. It's less of a problem in programming but it certainly is. Recent example: Mazda Windshield and Safety feature disabling - wouldn't tell me how to disable

## Taking the Fun out of Coding
Letting AI take care of coding tasks can make you lazy and takes the joy of figuring out complex problems of your own.
