# Code Magazine Article: Securing IIS Web Sites with Let’s Encrypt Certificates

I'm happy to point at my new CoDe Magazine article [Securing IIS Web Sites with Let's Encrypt Certificates](http://www.codemag.com/article/1801071) which is in the January/February edition issue:

I've written a few times about [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), which is an open source platform and protocol that provides free TLS certificates along with an API to facilitate automation of the certificate generation process. Additional tools provided by third parties then provide support features that make it drop dead simple to automatically create certificates and install them into Web Servers of choice.

This article summarizes the hows and whys of Lets Encrypt and provides a quick start on how you can use Lets Encrypt with standalone IIS servers. There really is no more excuse for even running that small hobby site that's public facing without IIS.
