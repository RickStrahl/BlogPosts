# Brainwashed

1.

People always think they're not brainwashed.

No? Are you one to flock to a movie on opening night? Worshipping Marvel, Star Wars, Seinfeld whatever? Buying Star Wars Legos? Buying an iPhone on day 1? Yeah that - classic brainwashing all of it.

It's easy and can happen to all of us. Try to recognize the bias and resist it.


2.

Now think how easy it is for multi-national corporations to drive messages at you - and succeeding to mess with your impulses. Do you think political entities wouldn't see this as an opportunity to drive emotions and impulses? It doesn't matter how smart you think you are, we're all susceptiple to it if we don't pay attention to our biases and pre-dispositions.

Pay fucking attention and recognize when you're being played.

3.

For politics these tactics are used regardless of left or right, socialist or libertarian. You may think that a particular track matches your views, but always remember what happens now can be reversed almost overnight. When you were holding the business end of the gun one minute,  you may now be finding yourself on the long end of the gun in the next minute.

4.

Ideologies should never be fixed. If you believe in socialism or libertarianism or something in between, and never adjust your mind set, you are just a fucking tool. Each ideology has a time and place when and where it makes sense. It's never always good or always bad. History goes in cycles each cycle works differently.



More and more every fucking thing in our society has become a scam.

Nothing is what it seems or as it's expected to be, everything is monetized and geared to screw the customer, via built-in obsolescence, nickel and diming, obfuscation, or outright fucking fraud.
